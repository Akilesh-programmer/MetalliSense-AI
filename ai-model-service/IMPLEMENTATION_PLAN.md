# MetalliSense AI Implementation Plan

## Project Architecture

We've implemented a properly structured ML-powered service for metal composition analysis with:

1. **MongoDB Integration**: Using your existing metal_grade_specs collection
2. **Proper ML Pipeline**: Separate data generation, model training, and service components
3. **Model Persistence**: Train models once and save them, rather than retraining on every startup

## Key Components

### 1. MongoDB Integration

- Enhanced `MongoDBClient` to connect to your existing "MetalliSense" database
- Added function to retrieve data from `metal_grade_specs` collection
- Updated `MetalKnowledgeBase` to load specifications from MongoDB first, with fallback to hardcoded data

### 2. Data Generation Pipeline

- Modified `generate_datasets.py` to create synthetic datasets:
  - **Composition Dataset**: For grade classification and composition prediction
  - **Recommendation Dataset**: For alloy addition recommendations
- Stores datasets in MongoDB collections for persistence

### 3. Model Training Pipeline

- Created `train_models.py` to train four ML models:
  - **Grade Classifier**: Predicts metal grade from composition
  - **Composition Predictor**: Predicts ideal composition
  - **Confidence Estimator**: Estimates confidence of predictions
  - **Success Predictor**: Predicts success probability of recommendations
- Saves trained models to disk in the `models/trained` directory

### 4. FastAPI Service

- Updated to load pre-trained models instead of retraining on every startup
- Proper error handling if models aren't available
- Same API endpoints but with more efficient implementation

```

## Setup Instructions

1. **Initialize ML Pipeline**:

   ```
   python init_ml_pipeline.py
   ```

   This will:

   - Generate synthetic datasets based on your metal grade specifications
   - Store these datasets in MongoDB
   - Train ML models using these datasets
   - Save trained models to disk

2. **Start the Service**:
   ```
   python start_service.py
   ```
   This will:
   - Load pre-trained models (no retraining)
   - Start the FastAPI service
   - Handle API requests using the loaded models

## MongoDB Structure

The service works with your existing MongoDB structure:

- **Database**: MetalliSense
- **Collections**:
  - `metal_grade_specs`: Your existing collection with metal grade specifications
  - `composition_dataset`: New collection for synthetic composition data
  - `recommendation_dataset`: New collection for synthetic recommendation data

## Benefits of This Architecture

1. **Efficiency**: Models are trained once and reused, not retrained on every startup
2. **Integration**: Works with your existing MongoDB data structure
3. **Reliability**: Fallback mechanisms if MongoDB data isn't available
4. **Scalability**: Separate components can be scaled independently
5. **Maintainability**: Clear separation of concerns

## Next Steps

1. Run the initialization script to generate datasets and train models
2. Start the service and test the API endpoints
3. Monitor performance and refine models as needed
